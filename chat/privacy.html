                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Protecting the Privacy Rights of Third Parties</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">If any content that you generate on our mobile app contain information about third parties, you must make sure you have permission to include that information in any communications that you share with others. We are not legally liable for the actions of our users.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Do Not Track Settings</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that we do not track your movement within our mobile app. Our mobile app does not obey such settings when transmitted to and detected by our mobile app. You can turn off tracking features and other security settings in your browser by referring to your browser’s user manual.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Links to Other Apps</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">Our mobile app may contain links to other Apps. These Apps are not under our control and are not subject to our privacy notice. These Apps will likely have their own privacy notices. We have no responsibility for these Apps and we provide links to these Apps solely for your convenience. You acknowledge that your use of and access to these Apps are solely at your risk. It is your responsibility to check the privacy notices of these Apps to see how they treat your PD.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Protecting Children’s Privacy</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">Even though our mobile app is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 13 , we realize that a child under the age of 13 may attempt to access our mobile app. We do not knowingly collect PD from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our mobile app, please contact us. Before we remove any information, we may ask for proof of identification to prevent malicious removal of account information. If we discover that a child is accessing our mobile app, we will delete his/her information within a reasonable period of time. You acknowledge that we do not verify the age of our users nor do we have any liability to do so.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Our Email Policy</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">You can always opt out of receiving further email correspondence from us or our affiliates. We will not sell, rent, or trade your email address to any unaffiliated third party without your permission except in the sale or transfer of our business, or if our company files for bankruptcy.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Our Security Policy</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">We have built our mobile app using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your PD. We also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your PD. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your PD or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature. We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our mobile app and to not share it with anyone.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Use of Your Credit Card</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">You may have to provide a credit or debit card to buy products and services from us. We use Google Play, and the third-party billing services they in turn use and have no control over these services. Our App does not in any manner see or read your credit card information. The information you enter goes into the Google Play interface and is processed by Google. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number since we have no access to it.</p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Transferring Personal Data from the European Union</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc"> Personal data (PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate, specifically the United States. The European Union has not found the United States to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For European Union customers and users, with your consent, your PD may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States. We will use your PD to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our mobile app, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="chat-subheading">Changes to Our Privacy Notice</h2>
                        <p class="chat-desc">We reserve the right to change this privacy notice at any time. If our company decides to change this privacy notice, we will post those changes on this link http://vajo.com/chat/privacy.html so that our users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time, we decide to disclose or use your PD in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account). Otherwise, we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our mobile app, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
